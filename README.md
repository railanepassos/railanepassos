## Hi there 👋

- 🎯 I currently work as a Quality Assurance Engineer at [Digibee](https://www.digibee.com/) a platform that minimizes costs and complexity while enabling rapid digital transformation.
- 🔙 Previously, I work at [Ci&T](https://ciandt.com/) as System Quality Analyst in a e-commerce product. I've worked mainly with process analysis, risk analysis, root cause analysis, test plans, interactive tests, maintenance and implementation of automated tests, on the mobile platform with python, pytest, appium and git technologies and on the web platform with javascript and cypress. Here I learned a lot about how a large company works, beyond delivering a minimum viable product, and I met incredible people who gave me the opportunity to share my knowledge and taught me a lot of cool stuff.
- 🔙 Previously, I worked at [Cubos](http://www.cubos.io/) as Quality Analyst in differents projects. Here I worked mainly with Javascript, Cypress, GitLab, Github.
- 👩‍💻 +5 years of experience with software quality.
- 💬 Ask me about software testing and software automation.
